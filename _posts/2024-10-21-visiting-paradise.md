### Summary:
*In this Article, Bro. Neville Johnson shares an insightful interpretation of the biblical verse "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8). He explains that while many people make it to heaven, not all of them see Father God directly. The purity of one’s heart, he says, determines the depth of their experience in heaven. Some souls may be content in paradise, happy to be there, but they might never reach the fullness of what God has for them because their hearts weren’t fully purified.*

*Bro. Neville draws on his personal experiences, including conversations with people in heaven, to illustrate this point. He recounts meeting individuals who see the glory of the throne from a distance or are visited by Jesus but have not yet seen the Father. These souls are joyful, yet they carry a subtle sense of missed destiny because they haven't seen God face-to-face.*

### Lets read about His experience in his own words,

"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

Wow.

Does that mean when you die, can you go to heaven and still not have a pure heart?

Yeah, you can.

If you're born again by the Spirit of God, you know, the thief on the cross didn't have time to have a pure heart. He was there within a few hours. Right?

So what does that mean? Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

A lot of people end up in heaven and they never get to see Father God. I know that will cause a lot of stir on the Internet.

Who cares?

I've been blessed by God to talk to a lot of people in heaven. And listen to me, this doesn't make me any better than you. It doesn't. This is part of my calling. It doesn't make me any better than you, all right?

So we have to be really careful about putting ministers on a pedestal. It is extremely dangerous. So don't do it. They're just flesh and blood like you. Ask my wife. Just flesh and blood like you, you know?

It says here, the pure in heart will see God. I've talked to people in heaven. They're in paradise. They have never seen God. They see the city and the glare of the throne in the far, far, far distance. They see the glory. Jesus visits them, but they have never seen the Father.

They made it to heaven and they are happy, but that's not the point. It's not about being happy. It's about destiny. It's about what God has called us to be.

My wife's father was a really hard man. When I went to ask him for my wife's hand, he came out with a shotgun. I thought, this is not a good start. He did get saved right at the end of his life. My wife and her mother got him into the Kingdom and he died.

He was a man who didn't like people. People got on his nerves, and you know what that's like, they get on yours too at times. He didn't like crowds. God gives you the desires of your heart, so you've got to be careful what you desire.

So I'm up there talking to my wife's mother, and I said, where's Dad? Where's your husband? Oh, he's way out in paradise. There are hardly any people out there, but he's got a house way out there. God gave him the desires of his heart. Incredible. When I told my wife, she said, I knew it. That's just what he was like.

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. You have to qualify.

These people are happy. I've talked to lots of them. There is a slight sense of regret, but it's not a strong feeling. They're happy just to be there, and they've made it, you know? But that's not what they were really called to.

It takes the pure in heart to end up at that level when you get to heaven."
